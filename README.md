This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This Application relies on the use of an API. Clone down the repository at [https://github.com/CurtCato/SendIt-Back-End-Capstone-API], and follow the instructions to set up the API. Make sure the API is running.

Once you have the API running, you will need to clone down the client side.

Clone down The client side repository at [https://github.com/CurtCato/SendIt-Back-End-Capstone-ClientSide]. After cloning down, cd into project. Run these commands.

npm start
